I have been considering developing this desktop application with a GUI in Python. Now, the primary reason why I prefer a desktop app instead of a web app, is to avoid any issues with data privacy as the supposed software needs to process sensitive data. I see that there are quite some GUI libraries out there, but some of them look quite ancient such as TKinter, or are very expensive for commercial use like PyQT or Sciter.

What are, according to you guys, the best practices for creating modern-looking desktop applications? Is it even a good idea? Ideally, I'm looking for a methodology that allows for modern-looking apps that Electron JS is known for. I've also looked at integrating python and Electron JS but this seems quite hacky (e.g.  [https://www.fyears.org/2017/02/electron-as-gui-of-python-apps-updated.html](https://www.fyears.org/2017/02/electron-as-gui-of-python-apps-updated.html)).

t3_gla9f3,I wrote a pair of modules: matroska and ebml,"Last year, I discovered [PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV), and found it to be useful to process media. However, as PyAV is python bindings for ffmpeg, and I am not terribly pleased with ffmpeg’s lack of support for certain Matroska features, I decided to get my hands dirty in the last month and decided to write my own Matroska muxer/demuxer, and as the Matroska format is based on EBML, I decided to write an EBML module to go along with it.

The matroska module supports all elements listed in [the specifications published at Matroska.org](https://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/index.html). Beyond simply exposing the entire DOM, here are some features I have implemented:

* Cluster, block, and packet iterators (with the ability to specify a start time or offset in file).
* Automatic decompression of compressed packets in read mode.
* Automatic creation of new clusters and cue entries (via Segment.mux(packet))
* Generating statistics (stored in tags)
* Automatic handling of block lacing and packet compression (again, via Segment.mux(packet))
* Support for using file objects (currently io.BufferedReader) in AttachedFile objects (in lieu of storing entire files in memory).

I have so far successfully managed to remux streams from one mkv file to a new one.

I expect I still have some bugs to work out (that I am not aware of) and some features to implement, but here they are:

[https://github.com/shersonb/python-matroska/](https://github.com/shersonb/python-matroska/)

[https://github.com/shersonb/python-ebml/](https://github.com/shersonb/python-ebml/)

I have found that I should be able to take packets demuxed with this module and decode them through PyAV, and likewise, encode frames with PyAV and mux them. I do not plan to implement encode/decode features in the module, though. I will likely write a new module in the future that interfaces with both modules (as well as any other container modules that I may stumble upon).

It would scan users that have recently liked a certain photo and calculate the likelihood of them following you back.

t3_gkzcoy,Adding tuples a bit faster by writing raw bytecode,"The `hax` library (https://github.com/brandtbucher/hax) allows you to insert bytecode operations inside normal Python functions. 

```python
from hax import *

@hax
def add_tuples(a, b):
    LOAD_FAST(""a"")
    UNPACK_SEQUENCE(2)
    ROT_TWO()
    LOAD_FAST(""b"")
    UNPACK_SEQUENCE(2)
    ROT_THREE()
    BINARY_ADD()
    ROT_THREE()
    BINARY_ADD()
    ROT_TWO()
    BUILD_TUPLE(2)
    RETURN_VALUE()
```

I used it to create a function that adds two tuples (or any other two 2-element iterables) element-by-element using https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/dis.html#python-bytecode-instructions as reference. It turns out that it might be slightly faster than adding tuples in native. Maybe someone with better benchmarking experience can measure the difference in execution time more accurately.

Premature P.S.: I'm not advocating using this kind of code in production, it's just an exercise!

## How it works

All computations in Python are happening on the _stack_. A stack is like an array, but you can only pop an element from its top or put a new element on top of it -- like a vertical stack of heavy books.

For example, to add two numbers -- 2 and 3 -- using a stack, you can:
1. Put 3 on top of the stack
2. Put 2 on top of the stack 
3. Take the top two elements from the stack and put their sum on top of the stack

In Python, bytecode is simply a sequence of instructions that operate on the stack.
You can look at the bytecode resulting from compiling a function using the `dis` built-in module:
```py
In [20]: import dis
In [21]: def add(a, b):
    ...:     return a + b
    ...:
In [22]: dis.dis(add)
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              2 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
```

Unlike assembly language instruction names, he operation names here are quite readable. You can read the bytecode sequence like this:

0. Load a local variable №0 (which is `a`) and put it on top of the stack

2. Load a local variable №1 (which is `b`) and put it on top of the stack

4. Take the top two elements from the stack and put their sum on top of the stack

(Now there's only one element on the stack -- the sum of `a` and `b`)

6. Take the top value from the stack and return it from the function.

So, step-by-step, the stack would change like this (the top of the stack being on the left):
```
0. |
2. | 3
4. | 2 3
6. | 5
```


Likewise, you can disassemble the `add_tuples` function. As you can see, it's almost identical to the implementation using the `hax` module.
```
  1           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              2 UNPACK_SEQUENCE          2
              4 ROT_TWO
              6 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              8 UNPACK_SEQUENCE          2
             10 ROT_THREE
             12 BINARY_ADD
             14 ROT_THREE
             16 BINARY_ADD
             18 ROT_TWO
             20 BUILD_TUPLE              2
             22 RETURN_VALUE
             24 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             26 RETURN_VALUE

```

Let's go through the function step by step. First, I'll explain what each instruction does, and then I'll show the stack diagram. Let's say that the tuples `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` were passed to the function as arguments, and the resulting tuple should have the shape `(xS, yS)`.

0. Load a local variable №0 (which is `a`) and put it on top of the stack

2. Unpack a sequence of 2 elements (i.e. put its elements on the stack)

4. Swap the top two stack elements (`x y -&gt; y x`)

6. Load a local variable №0 (which is `b`) and put it on top of the stack

8. Unpack a sequence of 2 elements (i.e. put its elements on the stack)

10. ""Rotate"" the top three elements on the stack. (`x y z -&gt; z y x`)

12. Take the top two elements from the stack and put their sum on top of the stack

14. ""Rotate"" the top three elements on the stack. (`x y z -&gt; z y x`)

16. Take the top two elements from the stack and put their sum on top of the stack

18. Swap the top two stack elements (`x y -&gt; y x`)

(step 18 is needed because `BUILD_TUPLE` accepts elements in the same order that 
`UNPACK_SEQUENCE` produces them)

20. Create a tuple out of the top 2 elements on the stack. 

22. Take the top value from the stack and return it from the function.

24. Put the `None` constant on top of the stack

26. Take the top value from the stack and return it from the function.

(The last two steps (`return None`) are redundant, just ignore them for now)


Here is how the stack evolves over time (again, the top of the stack is on the left). Try stepping through the instructions by hand and see how it works for yourself.
```
0. | a
2. | x1 y1
4. | y1 x1
6. | b y1 x1
8. | x2 y2 y1 x1
10.| y1 y2 x2 x1
12.| yS x2 x1
14.| x1 x2 yS

As you can see, quite a lot of stuff is going on there, and it takes effort just to explain how it works. So don't rush to micro-optimize your code with `hax`.


## Benchmarks (don't take them too seriously!)

`timeit` log for my machine: https://pastebin.com/D6ieGpg0

### With dirty hacks:

```python
from hax import *

@hax
def add_tuples(a, b):
    LOAD_FAST(""a"")
    UNPACK_SEQUENCE(2)
    ROT_TWO()
    LOAD_FAST(""b"")
    UNPACK_SEQUENCE(2)
    ROT_THREE()
    BINARY_ADD()
    ROT_THREE()
    BINARY_ADD()
    ROT_TWO()
    BUILD_TUPLE(2)
    RETURN_VALUE()
```
Time: ~195 ns

### With tuple unpacking:

```python
def add_tuples(a, b):
    x1, y1 = a
    x2, y2 = b
    return (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)
```
Time: ~236 ns

### With array index notation:

```python
def add_tuples(a, b):
     return (a[0] + b[0], a[1] + b[1])
```
Time: ~286 ns",Python,  tuples a bit faster by writing raw   the hax library  allows you to insert   operations   normal python functions   python from hax import   hax     b           unpacksequence      rottwo           unpacksequence      rotthree           rotthree           rottwo           returnvalue   i   it to create a function that   two tuples or any other two  element iterables elementbyelement using  as reference it turns out that it might be slightly faster than   tuples in native maybe someone with better benchmarking experience can measure the   in execution time more accurately  premature ps im not   using this   of   in   its just an exercise   how it works  all computations in python are happening on the stack a stack is like an array but you can only pop an element from its top or put a new element on top of it  like a vertical stack of heavy books  for example to   two numbers         using a stack you can   put   on top of the stack   put   on top of the stack    take the top two elements from the stack   put their sum on top of the stack  in python   is simply a sequence of instructions that operate on the stack you can look at the   resulting from compiling a function using the   builtin   py in   import   in       b          return a  b      in                                        a                                    b                                   returnvalue   unlike assembly language instruction names he operation names here are quite   you can   the   sequence like this      a local variable №  which is a   put it on top of the stack      a local variable №  which is b   put it on top of the stack    take the top two elements from the stack   put their sum on top of the stack  now theres only one element on the stack  the sum of a   b    take the top value from the stack   return it from the function  so stepbystep the stack   change like this the top of the stack being on the left                         likewise you can   the   function as you can see its almost   to the implementation using the hax                                       a                 unpacksequence                            rottwo                                    b                 unpacksequence                            rotthree                                   rotthree                                   rottwo                                                  returnvalue                                   none                 returnvalue    lets go through the function step by step first ill explain what each instruction     then ill show the stack   lets say that the tuples x  y    x  y  were   to the function as arguments   the resulting tuple   have the shape xs ys      a local variable №  which is a   put it on top of the stack    unpack a sequence of   elements ie put its elements on the stack    swap the top two stack elements x y  y x      a local variable №  which is b   put it on top of the stack    unpack a sequence of   elements ie put its elements on the stack     rotate the top three elements on the stack x y z  z y x     take the top two elements from the stack   put their sum on top of the stack     rotate the top three elements on the stack x y z  z y x     take the top two elements from the stack   put their sum on top of the stack     swap the top two stack elements x y  y x  step    is   because   accepts elements in the same   that  unpacksequence   them     create a tuple out of the top   elements on the stack      take the top value from the stack   return it from the function     put the none constant on top of the stack     take the top value from the stack   return it from the function  the last two steps return none are   just ignore them for now   here is how the stack evolves over time again the top of the stack is on the left try stepping through the instructions by     see how it works for yourself     a    x  y     y  x     b y  x     x  y  y  x     y  y  x  x     ys x  x     x  x  ys    xs ys    ys xs    xsys   as you can see quite a lot of stuff is going on there   it takes effort just to explain how it works so   rush to microoptimize your   with hax    benchmarks   take them too seriously  timeit log for my machine    with   hacks  python from hax import   hax     b           unpacksequence      rottwo           unpacksequence      rotthree           rotthree           rottwo           returnvalue  time     ns   with tuple unpacking  python     b     x  y   a     x  y   b     return x   x  y   y   time     ns   with array   notation  python     b      return a   b  a   b   time     ns

t3_gl05sb,I made a calculator that takes a polynomial input and outputs its derivative,"[Example input and output](https://i.imgur.com/iL5QLdK.png)

Hello! I thought I would share the project I made for my AP Computer Science: Principles class. It's a calculator that takes the derivative of an input. I have some other experience with Java but this is my third time using python and I must say, I absolutely love it. The input is completely whitespace-independent and allows the user to input any polynomial expression with any integer coefficient or power (including 1, 0, and -1). Since the program only takes polynomial expressions as inputs, it only uses the power rule, but this project was more about learning about string manipulation than anything else.

I made a rule for myself that I would not look up anything while working on the project and instead completely do it on my own. For this reason, I expect that it is quite unoptimized and I might have done some unconventional stuff, so I would really appreciate some feedback on how I can improve. Obviously with something like this, formatting and parsing the input was 95% of it, while the actual derivation was nothing.

Here's the code:

The class is all online inside of their browser book, of sorts, with some end of chapter quizzes that have you type code but no actual IDE. 

I have downloaded PyCharm so I can start getting used to it and it seems great. The course doesn't require it, you can do everything in their software.

I've started saving the code in their own .py files when it's something I want to remember. 

Should I be learning Emacs? I'm aware of the Emacs vs Vim dispute but their was only an install option with Emacs. Should I bother learning one of them over the PyCharm interface?

This is my first Python library I've created. In all honesty, the (rumors?) of Elon Musk and Grimes naming their baby ""X AE A-12"" made me and a friend think they must've used a random string generator to come up with it. I decided to make one myself. I'm sure there are libraries out there already, but I wanted to make my own.

There is a separate function each for generating strings, sentences, and paragraphs. You can set parameters for min/max length of everything, as well as defining which sets of characters you want (lowercase, uppercase, symbols, and numbers).

There are a few applications for this I can think of. One is generating random passwords/security keys. Another is generating filler ""lorem ipsum"" style text for various reasons, while also including numbers and symbols. I've used it for a program that randomly writes to an SQL database.

Eventually, I'd like to create this in JavaScript as well. Feel free to download it, provide feedback, whatever you wish.

I wanted to learn Python this week, so decided to write a TD Ameritrade trading terminal using their API. I am a total noob so dont roast me too hard.

One kind of neat thing about this, is TD Ameritrade has no quick command line trading system....which I have used previously trading at prop firms. I often find myself wanting to enter / exit trades quickly, and the mobile app is buggy and slow - and the website trading, well it kinda sucks. So I created a way to simply execute trades doing something like *'b 10000 fb 210' .* Which would **Buy $10,000 worth of FB at 210.** As fast as you can type, you can trade!

I have never done anything on Python, and right now I'm trying to make Autoclicker to connect to VPN.

So basically it should be moving mouse -&gt; clicking shortcuts -&gt; copying security code - entering password and clicking connect.

I have used Mouselogger to find out where is (x, y) for each shortcut and button.

So its calculated properly, but the script still missing shortcuts. I think I need to set up a delay ? I did delay = 4, but it seems like it's not working.

Any advice, please? Also if you know a better way to do that, I would be happy to hear.

I know it's personal settings here, but to clarify here's the code:

    from pynput.mouse import Button, Controller as MouseController
    from pynput.keyboard import Key, Controller as KeyboardController
    
    delay = 4
    mouse = MouseController()
    keyboard = KeyboardController()

What you need to prepare:

✅ install Python and git, obviously! :P

✅ pip install pipx

✅ pipx install pyscaffold

✅ Log in to these websites: github.com, pypi.org, readthedocs.org

&amp;#x200B;

🔨 [https://cirr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://cirr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

&amp;#x200B;

I used:

➡️ PyScaffold for the template, and it takes care of most of what's below

➡️ Pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality

➡️ Travis for continuous integration (I forgot to show it, but here's the build passing:  [https://github.com/Laurentiu-Andronache/cirr/runs/675249067](https://github.com/Laurentiu-Andronache/cirr/runs/675249067))

➡️ Pytest for testing (note that I might have been wrong about installing it with pipx; if you want to run ""pytest"" directly instead of ""python setup.py test"", do ""pip install pytest pytest-cov"" in your current environment)

➡️ Sphinx and  ReadTheDocs for the documentation (the documentation is often as important as the program itself!)

➡️ PyPi to share my package with the world

➡️ GitHub to make my package open-source

t3_gjqdc3,I am looking to distribute a program I made with python; is there some licenses I need to know about that I should include with it?,"Greetings all,

Let's get out of the way that there's a TL;DR at the end, that I'm not sure if this is the right sub to ask, and that I'm not a native speaker (and am particularly out of it today, thus my sentences are so wonky and clunky --they aren't as much usually, but I tried to keep it as 'normal' as I could, below).

Onto the topic: I've made a program in Python that I'd like to share with my friends (and possibly whoever else stumbles upon it). I've sent older versions to a few friends mostly for testing, but it's hard to send with my slow internet so I thought I'd turn to an online service --so I upload once only (for each new version), and then they download-- as opposed to sending to each person individually.

So I thought, why not make it more widely avalable? Maybe GitHub or something else, I've not really decided completely yet. But when more people than just my friends look at my program, I'm afraid someone will find that I am missing the required licenses (if any) and I'll be in (legal?) trouble. If it means anything, I am not looking to sell the program, it is as free as free beer (I'm also open to distributing the source code if needed, though I've learnt it is not required so I don't see why would I).

The program I'm looking to distribute imports from built-in modules only, so my worry is not about module-specific licensing. But it is built into an exe with PyInstaller, and I'm also using an installer maker called NSIS --anyone knows about it and if it requires some COPYING.txt or such file distributed with it? Same question goes for PyInstaller.

TL;DR: I made a program, built to exe (and required folders) with PyInstaller, to installer with NSIS. Need I distribute any license with this or am I free to distribute the bare thing? I'm not selling the program, it is free.

I am sorry if this is very easy to find out, I don't know how to look for it as my knowledge of English is limited, especially when it comes to specific technical terms of areas I'm not familiar with, like legal issues. Often it happens that I don't know how to word the phrase in English to look something up, and there isn't enough --or any-- info available in my language.

Thank you in advance very much. \^^",Python,i am looking to   a program i   with python is there some licenses i   to know about that i     with it greetings all  lets get out of the way that theres a   at the   that im not sure if this is the right sub to ask   that im not a native speaker   am particularly out of it   thus my sentences are so wonky   clunky they arent as much usually but i   to keep it as normal as i   below  onto the topic ive   a program in python that   like to share with my     possibly whoever else stumbles upon it ive sent   versions to a few   mostly for testing but its   to   with my slow internet so i thought   turn to an online service so i   once only for each new version   then they   as   to   to each person    so i thought why not make it more   avalable maybe github or something else ive not really   completely yet but when more people than just my   look at my program im   someone will   that i am missing the   licenses if any   ill be in legal trouble if it means anything i am not looking to sell the program it is as free as free beer im also open to   the source   if   though ive learnt it is not   so i   see why   i  the program im looking to   imports from builtin   only so my worry is not about   licensing but it is built into an exe with pyinstaller   im also using an installer maker   nsis anyone knows about it   if it requires some copyingtxt or such file   with it same question goes for pyinstaller    i   a program built to exe       with pyinstaller to installer with nsis   i   any license with this or am i free to   the bare thing im not selling the program it is free  i am sorry if this is very easy to   out i   know how to look for it as my   of english is   especially when it comes to specific technical terms of areas im not familiar with like legal issues often it happens that i   know how to   the phrase in english to look something up   there isnt enough or any info available in my language  thank you in   very much

I've been recently working on a [new character encoding detection library in Python](https://github.com/chomechome/charamel). The first usable version has been released this week.

Honestly, there is no other library that covers all character encodings available in Python, has good accuracy and reasonable speed.
[Chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) is slow, narrow, unmaintained. The most popular library nevertheless. 
[cChardet](https://github.com/PyYoshi/cChardet) is fast due to C++ implementation but is not really accurate. 
[charset_normalizer](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer) sounds reasonable on paper but is both slow and inaccurate.

Since I use encoding detection quite frequently, I decided to fix this myself. I scraped a lot of multi-lingual data and built a machine learning model that for a given byte string predicts all encodings that could correctly decode it. Basically, it solves a multi-label classification task. To keep it fast, I used a linear model on top of uni- and bi-gram byte-level features. It also allows to implement the inference step without any dependencies. Surprisingly, this worked really well.

t3_giwbwf,I made a solver for Tents and Trees using constraint programming,"Hi !

I made a solver for the game ""Tents and Trees"" ([link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frozax.tentsandtrees&amp;hl=en)). It's a fun puzzle game, that is kind of similar to a Sudoku mixed with a Minesweeper. 

Here's the github repo : [https://github.com/LoicGoulefert/tentsntrees](https://github.com/LoicGoulefert/tentsntrees) .

I've made a first ""naive"" solver that implements game's rules with for loops. This approach is tedious and cannot solve non-deterministic instances of the game. I then use constraint programming with Google's [OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/introduction/python), more specifically their [CP-SAT](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver) solver, which can solve every (solvable) instance of the game.

t3_gjbbdj,"Random Encryption // First Real Py Project, Not Bad","Hello!

I finished coding a python encryption tool today, only took a few hours. This is basically my first &gt; 100 line script in Python as I'm normally more reserved to languages like C#, especially right now. I barely knew the full syntax for everything I needed to create this so I was pretty proud to complete it without a single copy/paste! Thus why I'm sharing it here.

How it works:  
 \- chooses which array creation algorithm to use (two slight alternations)  
 \- uses code to create randomly ordered number array with  
   no repeats  
 \- iterates through dictionary, replacing every key (letter / char),  
   with an again randomly picked number, done by randomly selecting  
   an index in the array, making sure the number isn't assigned to another  
   char/used already, then assigning it to the approx. char in the dictionary.  
 \- the users input is then iterated through, with each char being used  
   to call its specified key in the dictionary. this key now has that  
   absolutely randomly picked # value assigned to it, and thus that  
   is what is ultimately used in the message.  
 \- decode part soon; iterating back through key to assign appropriate letters.  
   if you are looking for this now it is easily done - look up 'parsing string  
   into a dictionary' i.e, then iterate through your message assigning each char  
   to its original value in that dictionary. you may have to switch the keys/values  
   rather than trying to reference in reverse, but i don't know enough about  
   python to know which is possible/most efficient. (you can test keys and values  
   with a for loop right?)  
   if not then parse from string but backwards, keys &gt; vals etc

Certain designs were needed only in my first concept, so that's why various aspects like, choosing between two slightly different algorithms, seem redundant. It is, but I'm going for 'absolute randomness,' so didn't exactly hurt to keep it.

Anyways, more detailed info can be found here, as well as the GitHub, sourece code, etc: [http://benkronoff.com/creations.html](http://benkronoff.com/creations.html)

More importantly though - since this is a Python community - can anyone give me some tips for moving forward, and various syntax 'facets' and habits to get into and start practicing? I enjoyed doing this, and definitely plan to try to incorporate more Python into my workflow in the future! 

Thanks for your reading!

t3_gj5lf0,Hosting a Python script online?,"First post here but I'm hoping you guys can help me out. Im currently developing a personal project that uses the Spotipy library to interact with the Spotify API. My python script lets you enter two Spotify user names and then it hits the API to get their saved likes, playlists, etc and then creates a new playlist that contains songs that both people liked and then adds it to their personal libraries. Im still adding some features and code cleanup but I'm starting to look into making this a public web app that anybody can use to create playlists with their friends but I'm not sure the best way to go about this. I'm familiar with React JS for front end development but Im not sure if I should go the route of writing a react/node app and just have the node server run the script. Or if I should look into python web frameworks like Django and just have the whole app contained in python.

Edit: One of my main concerns is how the spotipy library authenticates users. After entering a username, it opens a webpage in your default browser where that user logs in to create a token.

That is essentially a tool to help you out.

I thought about it and tried searching for visualizers like that but for numpy, or the very least matrix operations visualizer.

I'm trying to export data after doing an SVD on a large matrix and am  wondering what the best way of exporting the data is. I tried doing:

svd\_matrix = np.linalg.svd(array)

np.savetxt('filename', svd\_matrix, delimiter = ',')

But it lead to this error: TypeError: Mismatch between array dtype ('object') and format specifier ('%.18e')

However, if I did:

U, E, V = np.linalg.svd(array)

and saved each matrix as an individual file, it worked fine. How can I keep it as a single file?

t3_gjez5k,Difference between the way functions are called.,"I have a doubt. In python we call the len function by len(list,string,etc) but functions like append are called like list.append(argument)

They both(len and append) are part of the class where they might have been defined like this

Def append(self,element)

Def len(self)

So my question is 
Why can’t we call len like this:
list.len()

Because we are basically passing the list to len.

I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, but hopefully no one gets too mad. 

Up until this point I have gotten used to using pycharm for most of the stuff I need to do. It is particularly useful since it has a nice variable explorer and I tend to deal with a lot of data that often needs reorganizing so being able to explore it visually is a nice feature. 

Even though pycharm works well for me, it often feels like overkill. When it's not inconvenient, I tend to use sublime text. However, with sublime text, debugging seems like a massive annoyance. So I am reaching out here to ask you guys for tips on good debugging practices in python.

And if you have good sources on this, they'd be much appreciated.

**Companies:** 

Here after clicking on the create contact button we are redirected to the company create form.

**Create-Company:** 

Now here after the update button is clicked with the filled out form details I want to redirect the form to the contacts page with the newly added company details shown below the create company button in a card form.

As expected it threw a nasty Module not found error. I added path to the root folder of the project in site-packages to PYTHONPATH, still the error persists.

t3_giljn8,python3 multiprocessing working on the same list of files,"So i have this folder that has a bunch of files (images) and i wanna move the files into another directory if certain conditions apply to it.

Now my problem is that when one process does move a file.. when another process tries to test it, it can't find it and it throws an error.

I save the files' names into a list before i start and the processes go through the list to select the files by their names like this 

\#for i in os.listdir(): do stuff

My question is: can i /should i lock the files until the previous process is done testing it?? and if yes.. will the the other processes skip it if they find it locked and will they come back to it later or not?? (since each process is doing its own test and needs to test all the files available).

Also.. when i do move a file i want its name to be deleted from the list of files' names and i want the other processes to be told that the list has been updated and update theirs.

t3_gigpav,Store all tweets tweeted during certain date range (Tweepy),"I am trying to retrieve all of the tweets matching a query between a start date and an end date. I am using the following code to store the tweets in a csv file:

for tweet in tweepy.Cursor(api.search, q=searchQuery, count=100, lang=""en"", since=""2019-12-01"", until=""2020-04-07"").items():

print(tweet.created\_at, tweet.text)

csvWriter.writerow(\[tweet.created\_at, tweet.text.encode('utf-8')\])

tweetCountTest += 1

print(tweetCountTest)

It works fine if I set the end (until) date after 2020-05-05, but just exits the loop when I put any date before that. Is there something wrong with my code? Ideally, I want to be able to store all the tweets matching my query tweeted in any date range. Today is 2020-05-12

Hi Reddit,

I'd like to preface my post by saying I'm a novice python developer learning to code, and decided to create a project to test and improve my coding skills. I've always been a fan of Mac menu bar applications, so I decided to create one to solve a problem I've been having.

In the spirit of Ramadan, I launched this small product to be able to check out today's prayer times on my Mac's menubar and receive a notification when it's time to pray.

Before even starting you need to consider whether the task is I/O or CPU bound or whether it's going to give you the boost you need. Also, the existence of GIL makes it tricky to write truly concurrent code. `concurrent.futures` module exposes a thin wrapper around Python's native `threading` and `multiprocessing` module. It enables you to quickly add concurrency to your python code and abstract away unnecessary complexities. In many simple cases, you can easily get away with just using the `concurrent.futurues` module.

I have only made some static pages with frontend and I want to learn Django

So I took a course in youtube and it teaches by creating a blog like an app with login registration and posting and deleting the blog. I see him type all the code but I wonder how does he know what he is doing or like how to people get that you need to do this for registration and are most of the code people write are just written by other people and they just tweak it to meet their needs or people do all the stuff by themselves. There are a lot of questions going on in my head, I see people learn to code and do so many awesome stuff (which I would like to do) but when I think about it or watch videos on how to do that stuff, I wonder how do they know how to do it, like while coding do you do a lot of searching on how to implement this feature and take some code and tweak it.

I have spent the last several weeks compiling my own aggregate dataset for covid19 analysis and have decided to make it publicly available [here](https://github.com/ryanskene/see19).

It has case and fatality counts covering over 300 regions including provincial / state level data for the US, Brazil, Canada, Australia, Italy, and China.

The data includes exogenous factors for each region (either country or state level) including a wide array of demographic age ranges, land and city density, daily average temperature, uvb radiation, relative humidity, pollution, the Oxford Government Response Tracker, Google mobility data, and some rough GDP and international travel estimates.

And its all rolled up into one csv file.

you can [download the csv directly from github](https://github.com/ryanskene/see19)

i have also developed a python package to easily download and further manipulate the dataset and generate a number visualization tools. [you can download the package here](https://pypi.org/project/see19/) or just \`pip install see19\`

I have used the package to generate all the charts I have posted here on reddit and on a new [twitter feed you can find here](https://twitter.com/covidcharts1). The data still has some kinks but it has become a pretty effective tool for me the last couple weeks.

t3_ghhqf2,PEP Proposal Feedback,"Hello everyone. I'm working on a PEP for Python and I wanted to get some feedback either on the feature I'm suggesting or the PEP itself. What are your thoughts?

# PEP: 9999 - Object Declaration and Function Invocation Decorators

* Author: Gino Vincenzini &lt;Gino.F.Vincenzini At Gmail dot Com&gt;
* Status: Draft Type: Standards Track
* Content-Type: text/x-rst
* Created: &lt;date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format&gt;
* Post-History: &lt;dates of postings to python-ideas and/or python-dev&gt;

# Abstract

Decorators are very powerful but they could be even more powerful if they could decorate an instance of a thing. This proposal would allow the writing of function/class decorators that decorate an instance of a class (and only that instance) or an invocation of a method (by treating it like an object). The rules for decorators would otherwise be the same.

# Motivation

There are several use cases that I've run accross where this feature could help. Take for example the colorama library, In order to style text, you have to add the styling to the beginning of the print call. These are constants and in theory, there's nothing stopping a user from changing them. But additionally, the color is a style, not the text itself which is what print is supposed to, well... print. Putting styling constants in between textual content

So what would be more expressive? Well, we could annotate the string or even the whole function with a Decorator:

    # in colorama.py
    def red(func):
    	if type(func) == 'function':
    		def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    			for string in args, kwargs.values():
    				string = Fore.RED + string
    			return func(*args, **kwargs)
    		return wrapper
    	else:
    		func = Fore.RED + func
    		return func
    
    @colorama.red print(""This message is in red!"")
    print(@colorama.red ""This message is also in red, SPANISH INQUISITION!!!!"", 
    		@colorama.blue ""Except this portion which is in blue, bet you didn't expect that!"", 
    		@colorama.green f""Here's an f-string in green: {2 + 2 =} Should be 5"")

Another use case would be constants. Python sort of has constants (objects with names in all uppercase) but the compiler doesn't really enforce it. You can do `CONSTANT_NAME = value` 100 times and nothing will scream at you saying ""you doofus! You can't change a constant!"". And that can't really change without breaking at least some code... but what if you could declare something a constant without adding a language feature?

    class const:
    	def __init__(self, o):
    		class const_o(o):
    			def __init__(self, o):
    				self.o = o
    			def __equ__(self, o):
    				if self.o is not None:
    					self.o = o
    				else:
    					throw ConstantError(""Cannot reassign constant value"")
    		return const_o(o)
    
    @const spanish_inquisition = 'Not Expected'
    @const camelot = 'Silly place'
    @const air_speed_velocity_of_an_unladen_swallow = 4.0 # On second thought, let's not do this one, tis a silly constant.
    
    spanish_inquisition = 'Expected' # Throws a holy hand grenade error
    camelot += ' of silly walks' # Also throws an exception at the count of 3... not 2, nor 4, and 5 is right out!

I'm sure there are other use cases that could be imagined but those two are the ones that I've thought of so far.

# Rationale

In PEP 614, Brandt Bucher says:

&gt;Special-casing the grammar to allow some useful cases would only complicate the current situation, and all but guarantee that the process would repeat itself sometime in the future. Further, one purpose of this grammatical change is to discourage the temptation to use hacks...  
&gt;  
&gt;In short: if we're removing somewhat arbitrary restrictions, we should remove all of them.

I agree with this sentiment and the domain is very similar. The only difference is that Brandt is proposing that any expression as long as it yeilds a decorator, should be a valid decorator. To that same point, my proposal is to loosen what a decorator can apply to.

# Specification

the current decorators syntax is...

decorator: '@' dotted\_name \[ '(' \[arglist\] ')' \] NEWLINE decorators: decorator+ decorated: decorators (classdef | funcdef | async\_funcdef)

and would change to be:

decorator: '@' dotted\_name \[ '(' \[arglist\] ')' \] \[NEWLINE\] decorators: decorator+ decorated: decorators (classdef | funcdef | async\_funcdef | func\_call | object\_ref)

# The last two items added do not currently exist in the current grammar but do exist in the language. See below explanation

func\_call and object\_ref would have to be added, but basically any sort of NAME or function invocation should be allowable (though to be honest, I'm not good at reading BNF Grammars).

# Backwards Compatibility

Removing this limitation should not impede any backwards compatibility. Decorators will continue to function the way they always did.

# Security Implications

I can't think of any.

# How to Teach This

The first step is teaching some of the decorators that implement this pattern (such as the colorama or const decorators above). Once a new pythonista is comfortable with using decorators on an object rather than a class or function, it's just a matter of showing them how these sorts of decorators are implemented. One can see in the code samples above that the returned object wraps the original value in the case of const, or in the case of the color wrapper, wraps the function to be called with its parameters altered.

Otherwise, decorators are taught exactly the same as they always have been.

# Rejected Ideas

hopefully not this one.

# Open Issues

Whether or not decorators will be allowed to have the expanded syntax in pep 614. If so, then this becomes even more powerful. Also could the decorator be object based and not just class or function based? I.e. would this become possible by implementing these two new rules?

    with Select(someVariable) as select:
        u/select.case('Value A')
        def value_A(value):
            print(value)
        u/select.case('Value B')
        def value_B(value):
            print(""This is not Value A"")
        u/select.default
        def select_default(value):
            print(""You need to select a valid value!"")

t3_gh84pl,My experience on further integrating Python in c++,"I have made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/gc691l/my_experience_learning_python_as_a_c_developer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) here about a week ago, praising Python about how nicely it works with c++. While I'm still amazed how nicely they work together and how easy everything was, I got greedy. I didn't want to *just* embed the interpreter, I wanted parallel Python script execution, mixed mode debugging &amp; combined callstack and compile time glue code generation. In this post I will talk about these 3 points and how I went about implementing them (or failing at getting them to work).

Parallel Python script execution

Concurrency and race conditions are a huge problem in the c++ codebase, let alone Python scripts modifying the same c++ variables. The way the c++ codebase handles concurrency, is that each class that reads or writes data gets a set of metadata attached to it at compile time. So a graph can be drawn of what classes read the same data and what classes edit data that other classes read later on. I won't get into the problem, but this setup is commonly found in Entity Component System (ECS) implementations. What I decided to do, was to create separate extension modules for reading c++ data and writing c++ data. This way, I could sort the Python scripts into a dependency graph based on what modules they import, and execute a lot of them in parallel. Great! But wait a second. My profiler shows  **absolutely no performance gain**. Moreover, I have measured a 3-5% slowdown! What's going on? Well it turns out that the GIL basically ensures that only one thread is running at a time. Bummer. Multiprocessing isn't really an option as I would rather keep the application contained in a single process. A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world as the c++ code is already highly parallel. It would have been nice to run scripts parallel as well. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to figure this out. If you have any ideas, please do share them!

Mixed mode debugging

I don't know about other IDEs, but Visual Studio provides a mixed mode debug option. Basically, it let's you set a breakpoint in Python and another in c++ and step through code, jumping from Python to c++ and back. How cool is that? It even manages to cobble together a combined callstack, showing where Python or c++ code was executed. Absolutely amazing. Thing is, I could not get it to work with an embedded Python interpreter. I followed one of the dozens of tutorials showcasing this super cool feature, but all of them are describing how to use it when extending Python, not embedding Python. So initially, I made a dummy Python extension and voila; it worked and it was magic. Once I got it to work I knew that I had to get this to work with the embedded interpreter, as this looked incredibly useful. Sadly, could not get it to work. This pains me to this day. I almost feel like I should't have discovered this feature, as I was so happy without knowing it existed. But once I got it to work in my dummy project and saw how amazing it was, I just couldn't go back to just a single debugger at a time. I feel like I'm back in the middle ages; using one debugger at a time.

Compile time glue code generation

There are many solutions, most prominently SWIG, that does just that; generates glue code. Since the project already had a custom in-house solution for c++ code gen, it really did feel redundant to have two large machinery, doing almost the same, eating up the build time. So I peeked around and implemented some very basic code gen for c++/Python binding - in Python! It's just so funny to me that Python generates c++ code that later on enables the embedded Python to access c++ data and vice versa. Boring task, but funny concept. Finally something I managed to figure out.

Sorry for the long post, I just though I'd share my experience further integrating Python and follow up on my last post, where I naively though everything was nice and easy. If any of you have any advice on using mixed mode debugging or somehow bypassing the GIL, please let me know, I would greatly appreciate any and all tips!

TL;DR I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/gc691l/my_experience_learning_python_as_a_c_developer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) saying how nice it was to embed Python in c++. But when trying to do advanced things, things go south real quick.

t3_gh5ddn,best practices for plotting in python,"I'm trying to learn more about plotting data in python.  This post is about making static plots (not brushing or zooming) in an interactive session (sitting at a terminal typing commands) in vanilla python (not ipython) using matplotlib and its descendants.

From what I can tell, a user who wants an interactive plotting experience needs to either (a) use ipython, or (b) call plt.pause(.001) every time a plot is made or updated.   I'd like to avoid (a) for a variety of reasons (not a fan of the 'cell' model, already have an editor I like and don't want to switch to notebooks, ...).  And (b) seems incredibly clunky, to the point where I feel I must be missing something.

In the following example:

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.ion()
    x = np.random.randn(100)
    y = np.random.randn(100)
    plt.scatter(x, y)

At this point I'd like to have a window pop open and show me the scatterplot.  However I get nothing until I call `plt.pause(.001)`.  If I dismiss the window through the window system I need to call `plt.pause(.001)` again.  Likewise if I want to add an axis label, etc.

**Question 1**: is there a ""plot viewer"" object that I should be using that can listen for plot updates and mouse events without manual intervention?

I'm also curious what happens when I call `plt.pause()`.  If I have 20 graph windows open and only one of them has changed, do all 20 get redrawn?  I have seen `fig.canvas.draw()` but have not been able to get that to work, and `ax.draw()` requires a ""renderer"" argument that I don't yet understand where to get or how to use.

**Question 2**: is there a way to instruct a single axes object to either apply latest upates or redraw itself, without affecting plots in other axes or figures?

**Question 3**: It seems like there have been several attempts to provide interactive plotting.  `plt.pause, plt.ion, plt.show(block=False)`.   I gather some of these are experimental (e.g. block=False).  Is there a ""stable"" interactive plotting experience is expected toe remain viable for the foreseeable future?

Thanks for the knowledge.

t3_ghfwxh,Can someone learn machine learning in just 4 months?,"My university is offering a ""Data Science and Artificial Intelligence"" 4-month minor where the courses  go from ""How to open a Jupyter Notebook"" to finishing ""Machine Learning"" (actual course title) in just 4 months, and the requirements are: NONE. That's right, they are mostly accepting students who have never coded before. The syllabus actually uses Python, R and SQL for different courses.

My question is: is this even remotely possible to the average economics or literature student? The worst part is that if they fail just one course, they can't graduate with their class and have to wait another year to do the whole thing again.

I've been coding in Python for 2 years with 6 months of professional experience and only recently got around to applying machine-learning and actually understanding what I'm doing. Unless they call loops ""machine learning"" these days, this doesn't really make sense to me.

A few non-CS friends asked me about it and I'm thinking about recommending that they don't take it, and try to learn Python another way if they are interested. Has anyone here learned Python + Machine Learning in 4 months or less and can attest that it's doable?

EDIT: The professors only say on the minor page that the ""minor is an exceptionally difficult one for many"" without any more details on the actual effort it would take to learn all of this in 4 months or the passing rate of previous years.

The BLPAPI package itself is easy, it was just:

t3_gh8jrp,Label Assignment with Sklearn One Hot Encoder,"Hey everyone!

I've been coding Data Science long enough to find popular packages that could use some enhancements. One problem that I've spent lots of time researching on stack overflow is figuring out a way to get labels out of the sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder package.

The problem is simple:

* Pandas DataFrame goes in
* Numpy Array comes out
* Labels are lost in the process with no convenient API to get them out

I've put some code together to help solve this problem once and for all. Please checkout [this article](https://medium.com/@vitddnv/how-to-assign-labels-with-sklearn-one-hot-encoder-e59a5f17df4f) for detailed explanation of how it works:

    from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder as SklearnOneHotEncoder
    
    class OneHotEncoder(SklearnOneHotEncoder):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super(OneHotEncoder, self).__init__(**kwargs)
            self.fit_flag = False
    
        def fit(self, X, **kwargs):
            out = super().fit(X)
            self.fit_flag = True
            return out
    
        def transform(self, X, **kwargs):
            sparse_matrix = super(OneHotEncoder, self).transform(X)
            new_columns = self.get_new_columns(X=X)
            d_out = pd.DataFrame(sparse_matrix.toarray(), columns=new_columns, index=X.index)
            return d_out
    
        def fit_transform(self, X, **kwargs):
            self.fit(X)
            return self.transform(X)
    
        def get_new_columns(self, X):
            new_columns = []
            for i, column in enumerate(X.columns):
                j = 0
                while j &lt; len(self.categories_[i]):
                    new_columns.append(f'{column}_&lt;{self.categories_[i][j]}&gt;')
                    j += 1

One of my homework assignments is to create a simple Blackjack game -- I've built out 90% of the game, but began running into the same issue.... My code gets hung about half the times I run it. 

I'm working in Jupyter Notebook and the game runs successfully \~50% of the time when I restart the kernel. The other half of the time, the game gets hung and doesn't report an error until I manually interrupt the kernel and get a ""KeyboardInterrupt"" message.

I'm assuming because I'm able to restart the kernel, re-run the program, which resets variable values, and have it work 50% means that there are no glaring causes for the issue (e.g. infinite loop), but let me know if you think I'm wrong.

Could this relate to computer performance (file size is 23kb), not adhering to programming best practices (making the file inefficient), or all of the above?

t3_ggvoqn,PopViz: CLI to visualize IMDb Rating Data of Television Shows,"This is my first full-fledged Python side project. I built it using seaborn/matplotlib, requests and beautifulsoup.   


r/dataisbeautiful recently had a slew of posts depicting the popularity of television show through a heatmap of ratings for episodes across seasons.  


I wrote a small program, PopViz (Popularity Visualizer), to automate this. It lets you search for a television show, or directly pass an IMDb ID, and then scrapes IMDb for rating data relating to that show. Finally, an image is generated displaying the heatmap, and some additional info about the show. The final product looks like [this](https://imgur.com/U7le5ha).  


Here's the link to the github repo:  [https://github.com/joshuanazareth97/popviz](https://github.com/joshuanazareth97/popviz) 

The program can be installed by cloning this repo, and running either \` pip install . \` or \` python [setup.py](https://setup.py) install \` from the root directory. Detailed usage instructions are present in the readme, but even merely calling the \` popviz \` command should allow you to generate a basic report.  
I have plans to upload it to PyPi in the near future, but that's perhaps after building out some more features.  
I'd love to hear any feedback about my code, I've tried to keep it as clean and easy to understand as possible.  


I won't claim that I'm a beginner to programming in general, or even Python,  but prior to this all I've worked on were existing codebases, webapps using Django which does all the initial legwork for you, or small one-off scripts. This was an amazing learning experience in scaffolding a project from scratch, including using tools like [setup.py](https://setup.py) for packaging, planning folder structure, using the debugger, and working with licenses, among others.

t3_ggst9b,OCR / network-graph project : Scan and process etymological dictionaries,"I'm starting a project to scan an etymological dictionary, and build a proximity/similarity/oppositeness graph for pairs of words based on their  roots/meanings.

It's all new  to me, and I'd love to get mentors/collaborators.  For now, I have some specific questions; just looking for pointers:

My first dictionary will have pages [like this.](https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00skeauoft/page/80/mode/1up)  

1. Preprocessing images before OCR: how to recognize the left/right side of pages (they have the convenient line down the middle)
2. Is there a Docker image or something similar with OCR service as a black-box?  I'm picturing I'll get the images from [Achive.org](https://Achive.org), and hand them over to an OCR service, and get back text.  This dictionary does have non-latin characters in it that are significant, so I guess the OCR probably needs some degree of trainability.
3. Have to find heuristics to recognize roots in the defs once they're in strings.
4. I figure they'll go into some kind of graph-oriented database.  I know nothing about graph theory, can anyone recommend a intro that might be relevant?  I'm thinking for example I might discover: ""vigil"" has root ""uigil"" that means ""flourish"", ""grow"" is a neutral-intensity semantic kin to ""flourish"", the history of ""grow"" is related to ""green"", so there's some connection between ""vigil"" and ""green"".  In that example ""flourish"" being related to ""grow"" isn't available from the dictionary I'm looking at, but I'm sure I can find similar relations.

My motivation is pure interest, wanting to look non-obvious algorithms that give insight/curiousities.

t3_ggnciu,absolute beginner to python and coding,"hey guys, newbie here. i just started learning python yesterday and really only know how to write simple strings, use the type function, and just basic integers.

The problem is not the coding itself, but rather understanding how it all works as a whole. I dont wanna learn how to write a script, but rather ***what*** it is that i am doing, why its working, you get the idea.

Some questions i have been struggling with and couldnt really find an answer to are (might be stupid questions, so i apologize in advance.

1. when writing code, am i correct by saying that every line of code is basically a sequence of instructions i am telling the computer to execute?
2. i have been going through some examples of code and a critical question i have which i believe will help me further learn and understand is &gt; for example, this piece of code. 

 fromaddr = ""you@gmail.com"" toaddr = ""target@example.com"" msg = MIMEMultipart() msg\['From'\] = fromaddr msg\['To'\] = toaddr msg\['Subject'\] = ""Python email"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I can see these words right, they are written in english, but how does the computer exactly understand these words? are these words assigned with a specific meaning to them? like do they have a meaning to the computer? sorry if this all sounds very stupid btw.

could someone perhaps explain the meaning behind this piece of code and explain me what every word really means?

another question i have is, ive noticed people starting their code with the word ''import'' and then some other word behind this, is this like importing pieces of code that could be useful to achieve said goals in a code?

how does one even begin a script ? like do they just write basic codes first to build a foundation of a program? and then begin coding more detailed features of said program?

You use the arrow keys to rotate and accelerate and the space bar to fire. The enemies are squares and the powerups are circles. It's still a work in progress, but it's definitely getting there. I need to add levels, images, and sound effects, but it's a playable demo for sure.

t3_ggf2kg,Is anyone working on better callable syntax?,"Is anyone working on better callable syntax?

Ie., to improve upon the lambda keyword -- or esp., to deal with the horrendous Callable\[\[str\], int\] type syntax?

Are there any PEPs / ideas brewing around this?

EDIT: to be clearer about this...

In  programming your ability to ""say what you mean"" with syntax is pretty paramount. That's why python's syntax is often widely praised for expression the code ideas, without hiding them behind syntax.

In functional programming the essential building block is the lambda (or just, ""function"" since in FP, there are no methods). 

Python has a very poor type signature for lambdas, ""Callable\[\[int\], int\]"" which \*should\* read ""int to int"" but buries that.

The example below is also hard to follow... the lambda keyword takes up most of the line! That's syntax getting in the way. 

index = lambda i: lambda x: x\[i\]

map(index(-1), \[""USA"", ""UK"", ""DE""\])

map(index(0), \[""USA"", ""UK"", ""DE""\])

t3_gfy7bu,Listening to Stars Blink with Python,"Hi Reddit.  This is a follow up post to a project idea I had in the past.  What I wanted to do was record a star with a camera, calculate the average brightness of each frame and turn that brightness into a sound.  So, you could listen to the star twinkling.  I figured python would be the best way to do it.  You can see my original posts asking about how to this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askastronomy/comments/b0fiy0/hearing_a_blinking_star/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b0fpl4/getting_sound_from_pictures/).  Well I finally finished this project and I want to show it off.

Over a few nights I pointed my telescope towards Arcturus and Sirius and recorded 30 seconds of each.  My equipment is below:

Telescope: 3"" Meade ETX 80
Camera: Iphone 6 for Sirius and Nikon D5600 for Arcturus.

When I ran the movie files through my python script I noticed that I could not hear anything.  It turns out that the stars blink between 1-2Hz, so you can't hear anything.  So, what I did was I increased the sound by a factor of 100 to get 100-200Hz.  This I could hear.  And it sounded like static.  Therefore, blinking stars sound like static.  I also got curious and plotted the time domain and FFT of the star blinking.  You can listen to the star blinking,see my FFTs and get my code [here](https://github.com/notaprogrammer12/Movie_to_FFT).

I dug into this a bit more and apprently there's been real academic work into modeling the atmosphere and predicting how stars blink.  The technical term is called Scintillation.  [Here's](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06921) a paper of modeling how stars blink and guess what.  Their FFT matches up with mine.

TLDR: Created python script to turn movies of stars blinking into sounds and FFTs.  Results and code can be found [here](https://github.com/notaprogrammer12/Movie_to_FFT).",Python,listening to stars blink with python hi    this is a follow up post to a project   i   in the past  what i   to   was   a star with a camera calculate the average brightness of each frame   turn that brightness into a    so you   listen to the star twinkling  i   python   be the best way to   it  you can see my original posts asking about how to this        well i finally   this project   i want to show it off  over a few nights i   my telescope   arcturus   sirius          of each  my equipment is below  telescope     etx    camera iphone   for sirius   nikon   for arcturus  when i ran the movie files through my python script i   that i   not hear anything  it turns out that the stars blink between   hz so you cant hear anything  so what i   was i   the   by a factor of     to get       hz  this i   hear    it   like static  therefore blinking stars   like static  i also got curious     the time     fft of the star blinking  you can listen to the star blinkingsee my ffts   get my      i   into this a bit more   apprently theres been real   work into   the atmosphere     how stars blink  the technical term is   scintillation    a paper of   how stars blink   guess what  their fft matches up with mine      python script to turn movies of stars blinking into     ffts  results     can be

This was an outstanding project I always wanted to engage and use it to bump my Python skills.
I have designed it very carefully, but also already refactored it countless times.
Currently I think I've got a solid architecture and a very flexible class-based modularization now being at its 13th alpha release.

**The design consists of 4 core concepts**:

1. IO modules
2. Transformer modules
4. Scripting Engine
4. Timer modules
5. Thread Runner / Signaling

---

1. **IO modules** can be anything in terms of input and output (net send/receive, user stdin/stdout, command i/o, etc) Importantly to note is that there must be one producer (which yields data - the input) and a consumer which does a callback on the data (send, execute, ...). Producer and consumer from different classes can be mixed to make all sorts of things (chat server, proxy chains, reverse shells, you name it)

2. **Transformer** modules act on top of IO modules and are a way to transform the data after input or prior output (e.g., transform line feeds, pack/unpack everything into HTTP or other higher level protocols)

3. The **Scripting Engine** ([PSE](https://github.com/cytopia/pwncat/tree/master/pse)) is very much alike to the bundled Transformer modules, only that actions come from user-created Python scripts which are then loaded and executed.

4. **Timer modules** are a way to run whatever actions periodically (this also allows UDP to be transformed into a stateful TCP-like protocol)

5. Finally the **Runner** takes IO modules, Transformer, Timer and PSE's and puts it all into threads (non-daemon) and takes care about shutdown handling via **signaling**.


---

Apart from that I've made sure the source is clean, type-safe (95%) and has a gazillion integratoin tests (13k LoC bash scripts) to ensure everything runs smoothly.

It also somehow let's me combine all the skills I've aquired over the years:

* Automation (pipeline, documentation generation)
* Tests written in Bash and also dockerized tests to emulate SIGINT behaviour to catch thread issues
* Extensive CI via GitHub Actions
* Threading, networking, OOP, type-safety
* Various modern Python tools
* Pip deployments
* Bad HTML: https://cytopia.github.io/pwncat/
* ...

And of course the the functionality itself, which actually came about from netcat's shortcomings when
I was working on HTB machines.

---

Feel free to have a look at the [code](https://github.com/cytopia/pwncat/blob/master/bin/pwncat) I still have quite a few `TODO` statements and questions I need to get answered. Also to note it is still in a alpha state as I haven't added all features yet, but it is already pretty stable and usable.

t3_gfyyby,python-kickstarter-track: Personal project to track and report real-time Kickstarter data and create forecasts. From webscraping to Machine Learning.,"This is a personal project that I wan to convert to a library.  The objective is to create a Kickstarter tracker that allows you to follow a list of projects and save their information once a day (to keep track of the development of the project). It will transform that information to create predictive models and apply Machine Learning.

Here are the steps we want to consider to build the Kickstarter tracker:

1.  Download data using my filesystem that allows the user to execute and save web scraping data from recent Kickstarter campaigns.
2. Have control of the execution and recollection of data using google instances.
3.  Analyze and clean that information.
4. Incorporate previous information (Collected data, monthly reported) for a better analysis or create more robust models
5. Create a forecast model out of the recollected data.
6.  If we have enough time, we will deploy that model with flask to create an app.  


Why? I'm launching my Kickstarter campaign, and I'm worried because it seems that Kickstarter traffic is being affected by COVID19 I want to have information to take the best strategy for my campaign. I think it is an excellent problem case that will involve many tasks in python until we reach our final product; A model that makes a prediction and allows us to see data and forecasts in real-time. I'm a Data Scientist, and I also work in the consultancy sector. I'm trying to advance as fast as possible to create an MVP that let me test the full version of the app, and then I will invest more time in creating a quality application. I'm not good following the Documenting Python Code, but I'm trying to improve and learn as I develop this project, any suggestion or feedback is encouraged. If anyone is interested in developing this kind of skills (Forecast, Data collection, automatization), this is a good way to start. After completing my objective, I will update and improve my code to build a more robust and friendly user app. If you stick to the project, I will describe the evolution of the project in the commits, documentation, and a brief resume on Reddit... I don't know I think it's cool right?

Hi !  I've made a package for creating guitar fretboard svgs based on fingerings or scale. It's highly customizable and support custom tunings. You can create diagram for ukulele, bass, 6-stings guitars, 8-strings guitars.   You can change colors, size of dots, size of frets and so on.

You can also display the  intervals ( root (1), the third (3) and so on ) and the different notes based on the root note.

Here's the code :  [https://github.com/antscloud/fretboardgtr](https://github.com/antscloud/fretboardgtr) . You can download it from pip (info in the readme)

Hope it'll be useful :)",Python,   a package for creating svg guitar   x   b    hi   ive   a package for creating guitar   svgs   on fingerings or scale its highly customizable   support custom tunings you can create   for ukulele bass  stings guitars  strings guitars   you can change colors size of   size of frets   so on  you can also   the  intervals  root   the       so on    the   notes   on the root note  heres the       you can   it from pip info in the    hope itll be useful 
t3_gfu8vu,Telegram bot that fetches video from YouTube for the top three tracks of all time by specified artist according to Last.fm charts,"This bot can fetch data using YouTube and Last.fm API as well as viciously scrape it if API limit is hit or an API is unavailable for some other reason.

Here is [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pltnk/toptracksbot)

The bot is deployed on Heroku and you can try it in Telegram: [@toptracksbot](http://t.me/toptracksbot)

To avoid hitting API limits too often YouTube ids of an artist's top tracks are stored in PostgreSQL database. By default this data is valid for 30 days and after that if someone requests such artist again data will be renewed.

Right now my YouTube API limit is pretty low so after a small amount of requests the bot will work a bit slower. If you know how to increase this limit please let me know.

You can easily deploy it by yourself using Heroku as well or Docker if you are familiar with it. I plan to add docker-compose.yml to the repo later. Do not forget to obtain bot token from Telegram, API tokens from YouTube and Last.fm and set them as according environment variables before deploying.

All feedback is highly appreciated and any contributions are welcomed!

I am developing a framework which is script-like, but now has grown to ~25 modules. There are some variables which I need frequently across different modules/classes like names, locations and configurations.
I initially get this data by reading a config file and doing some computations on this. 

In the past I was able to share most of this data by environment variables which were generated outside of the Python interpreter. For various reasons this is not possible anymore. 

It is enticing to just read the config file in the beginning and add the data to os.environ and use it from there. But this does not feel pythonic to me.

Another option would be to create a class that stores all the data as class variables which is then imported from all modules.

The third option is to pass the needed data to all classes/methods that need them, but that would significantly bloat the classes/methods for data that is static during the lifetime of the framework.

Does anyone has a recommendation or some downsides to my proposed solutions?",Python,can i use osenviron to share   across   hey everyone  i am   a framework which is scriptlike but now has grown to      there are some variables which i   frequently across     like names locations   configurations i initially get this   by   a config file     some computations on this   in the past i was able to share most of this   by environment variables which were     of the python interpreter for various reasons this is not possible anymore   it is enticing to just   the config file in the beginning     the   to osenviron   use it from there but this   not feel pythonic to me  another option   be to create a class that stores all the   as class variables which is then   from all    the   option is to pass the     to all   that   them but that   significantly bloat the   for   that is static   the lifetime of the framework    anyone has a   or some   to my   solutions

t3_gfc47x,Source assistant in WingIDE,"Hello!

I am using WingIDE for years now. I am not a professional programmer and its simplicity is what I always loved about it.

However, now I have a problem with its autocompletion and source assistant (source assistant helps by showing you which parameters a method requires once you type method name in the editor, saying this just in case its named different elsewhere).

&amp;#x200B;

Current project I'm working on has two scripts: *logic.py* and *blocks.py*.

*Logic* has a class *SignalCreator* and some other classes inside.

Class *SignalCreator* has some methods inside it (in my case, I need *allZeros* method).

*Blocks* script imports *logic* script (successfully as well), however, if I start typing SignalCreator.allZ... autocomplete doesn't suggest anything, source assistant doesn't show what it usually does as well.

If I run the script, it runs successfully and everything works as expected, but considering the *logic* script has dozens of methods and a couple of classes inside, it's really annoying having to switch tabs every now and then.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone encountered this on Wing or any other IDE? Thank you.

t3_gf4zun,There has to be a better way to write this...,"Hi all,

I'm a C# programmer by trade, but at home I use Linux and whilst I could write some of my home projects now using dotnet Core, I choose to use Python, because...well, just because.

I've made a footswitch to help me with home recording (hard to use a mouse when sat between 2 mics with an acoustic guitar on your lap).

I've written a small program in Python that emulates the keypresses and sends them to my DAW depending on which footswitch I press.

I have a ""Shift"" button, and the values that are sent are pulled from a json file:

    {
    ""buttons"":[
    {
      ""1"":[[4,82],""UP""],
      ""2"":[[32,21],""DOWN""],
      ""3"":[[4,81],""RECORD""],
      ""4"":[[32,5],""ARM""]}
    ,
    {
      ""1"":[[74],""LEFT""],
      ""2"":[[77],""RIGHT""],
      ""3"":[[1,44],""PLAY""],
      ""4"":[[44],""STOP""]
    }]
    }

The ""shift"" button iterates through the array - in this case there are only 2 items in that array.

Depending on which number in the array is being used (I've called them 'patches'), an LCD displays the available options using the text in the json data, and then the corresponding keypress will be sent to a method I've called ""send_keystroke(key)""

If you have 5 minutes of free time would you mind filling a quick survey about text-adventures and python? This is mostly aimed at people who have written text adventures in python before but there are questions for everybody and all the data I gather will be very useful.   


 Please read the following disclaimer first:

t3_gew5lq,Python code to print words from any webpage to the console,"Hello,  


I'm getting my first python steps, and I'm trying to follow this very good tutorial:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxiJ92-4Qys&amp;list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC\_&amp;index=35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxiJ92-4Qys&amp;list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_&amp;index=35)   


I'm having problems in this one.  
This great dude is teaching how to print on the console every word from a webpage.  
I'm trying to replicate that to the wikipedia code page. I wanted to print the words from the ""Content"" section, like the ""Theory"", ""Variable-lenght codes"", etc.  


So the code from the videos is:  


    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import operator
    
    
    def start(url):
        word_list = []
        source_code = requests.get(url).text
        soup = BeautifulSoup(source_code)
        for post_text in soup.findAll('a', {'class': 'index_singleListingTitles'}):
            content = post_text.string
            words = content.lower().split()
            for each_word in words:
                print(each_word)
                word_list.append(each_word)
    
    
    start('https://buckysroom.org/tops.php?type=text&amp;period=this-month')


and my code is:  


    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import operator
    
    
    def start(url):
        word_list = []
        source_code = requests.get(url).text
        soup = BeautifulSoup(source_code,""html.parser"")
        for post_text in soup.findAll('a', {'class': 'mw-editsection-bracke'}):
            content = post_text.string
            words = content.lower().split()
            for each_word in words:
                print(each_word)
                word_list.append(each_word)
    
    
    start('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code')
    

so i just changed this lines:  


9: `soup = BeautifulSoup(source_code,""html.parser"")`  
10:`for post_text in soup.findAll('a', {'class': 'mw-editsection-bracke'}):`  
18:`start('`[`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code)`')`

t3_gez95r,What does the parameter 'length' in pyttsx3 refer to exactly?,"Docs located here:

[https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engine.html#module-pyttsx3.engine](https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engine.html#module-pyttsx3.engine)

I'm using a code pretty analogous to the example given on this page, listed as

"" Running a Driver Event Loop""

The primary difference being i'm running it recursively, feeding it a string that generates on a timer, after each iteration.

Basically, in def onWord() where it says  print('word', name, location, length), i am feeding it a length of 0, and it reads me the word i input as name.... but then it prints again and outputs None. And the ""length"" of None increases like so each iteration:

0

431680

809120

809120

1215200

1215200

1649600

i had been expecting maybe length to refer to substring, or location as applies to the string or even queue sent to driver or something like that. I've been getting segfaults on linux and have traced it back to libespeak... so i think what is happening is this is evidence that instead of overwriting the same area of memory it keeps stacking until it exceeds the limit. Does this sound like a good theory? And can anyone suggest how to tell this module to overwrite the same area of memory rather than stack it up until mothereffing infinity?

t3_gehmsb,Effortlessly navigate between browser and IDE while working on GitHub,"Hi everyone,

Many IDEs (like PyCharm) have fuzzy find capabilities for files - it saves a lot of time, compared to searching the file directory tree! And most of you working on GitHub probably know when reviewing PRs there's a copy to clipboard button on each file - which allows you to fuzzy find the file quickly on your system.

But I found that that's not the most optimal flow when doing code review so I created a browser extension (my first browser extension ever actually). It allows you to simply click on any line number and it'll copy to your clipboard the file path suffixed with the line number, so you can go to that specific place in code in your IDE. This:

1. **Saves** **you** ***time.***
2. **Allows you to keep** **your** ***focus*** **instead of breaking it constantly.**
3. **No more unnecessarily loading your short term** ***memory*** **with arbitrary information like line numbers (which could be long - 3,4,5 digit numbers for longer files).**

This can possibly be useful for terminal users as well, it's not necessarily IDE specific - for example I've used it with vim in combination with [vim-fetch](https://github.com/wsdjeg/vim-fetch).

I'd love to hear your opinions and also welcome contributions to the open source project: [https://github.com/NickyMateev/Line-Clipper/](https://github.com/NickyMateev/Line-Clipper/)

t3_gerov8,Super confused on how to make this work!,"I am having a couple of problems with this section of my code. This is suppose to be a program that gives the player a hand of letters and then the play creates whatever words they can with their hand.  This portion is supposed to determine whether a word entered is valid.

The first problem involves the \*  which is given as a ""free letter"" but any time it is used there is a Value Error that says "" '\*' is not in list"".

The second problem is, I believe, in the ""for letter in word\_list"" section of code. Every time the code runs the word submitted is outputted as invalid. The if statement is skipped and immediately jumps to the else. I know this because I switched the ""True"" and ""False"" and then every submitted word was true, regardless of if it was a real word or if the letters used were in the hand. I just can't figure what I need to change in order to make that work properly.

Any help is appreciated! I am very new to this so it might be something really simple. I'm just not sure.

t3_gegd2l,"Atbswp, the minimalist macro recorder","# Introduction

[atbswp](https://github.com/rmpr/atbswp)  is a minimalist, open source, multiplatform macro recorder written in Python. It allows the user to record his mouse and keyboard actions and reproduce them identically as many times as wanted. Created by  [u/rmpr_uname_is_taken](https://www.reddit.com/u/rmpr_uname_is_taken/).

# Motivation

atbswp is the result of frustration with tinytask (discontinued now) which is not available natively on Unix like systems.

# Future

Many features of tinytask are already present in the current pre-alpha version of atbswp, the one that have not been yet replicated are compile to an executable for the host platform and set a replay speed, which are on the roadmap and will be the main focus for the next development.

Any feedback, reviews or PRs are welcome !

t3_ge80u8,I'm having a hard time understanding the @ decorator...,"Hey r/Python

I've tinkered with Python off and on for a couple years, however, with all the things going on I'm trying to learn more and understand better some parts of the language I've been able to blatantly avoid. This week has been the @ decorator.  


This code from Stackoverflow:  


    import operator  
    class Spam(object): 
    
       def __init__(self, description, value):
           self.description = description
           self.value = value
           description = property(operator.attrgetter('_description'))
    
    
        @description.setter
        def description(self, d): 
           if not d: raise Exception(""description cannot be empty"")
           self._description = d
    
        value = property(operator.attrgetter('_value'))
    
    
        @value.setter
        def value(self, v):
            if not (v &gt; 0): raise Exception(""value must be greater than zero"")
             self._value = v

I do not understand the logic flow of this block at all. I do know the following:

1. We create the class Spam
2. Spam has 2 attributes, description and value
3. I'm lost

&amp;#x200B;

If someone has the patience to explain this, it would be greatly appreciated.  To me it looks like '\_description' and '\_value' are completely undefined.

I'm teaching programmin to my girlfriend, what exercices would you recommand, not really python specific stuff (like playing with tuples or such specifics of python)

So far I've made her (without helping her too much)

* ask a number in the console and print x time ""iteration + counter"" (for loop)
* Made her make a game that ask a number and tells you ""higher"" or ""lower"" (while loop, with if)

any ideas of other simple programs? So far she know variables (primitive and strings), methods, if/else if/else, for, while, do while, she is aware of variables's scopes.

* Then I intend to teach her about list and array then iteration with for each
* After that sorting those lists and arrays
* Then String manipulations
* Then reading and writing in a file
* Then objects
* Then inheritance (finding a read concrete example for this will be hard\^\^, I only use it in big projects)

She's having a hard time with methods but I can't find an example where code needs to be reused to show her ""here you see, this way you don't have to write the same thing two times""

She is the kind of person who need a concrete example otherwhise it won't click in her brain.

t3_ge61kw,[R] Announcing the release of StellarGraph version 1.0 open-source Python Machine Learning Library for graphs,"[StellarGraph](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph) is an open-source library implementing a variety of state-of-the-art graph machine learning algorithms. The project is delivered as part of CSIRO’s Data61.

We are thrilled to announce the **major milestone of a** [**full 1.0 release**](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/releases/) **of the library;** the culmination of three years of active research and engineering. 

V1.0 extends StellarGraph performance and capability with new algorithms for spatio-temporal data and graph classification, an updated StellarGraph class, and better demo notebooks and documentation.

New algorithms include:

* GCNSupervisedGraphClassification: supervised graph classification model based on Graph Convolutional layers (GCN).
* DeepGraphCNN: supervised graph classification based on GCN, a new SortPooling layer and asymmetric adjacency normalisation.
* GraphConvolutionLSTM: time series prediction on spatio-temporal data, combining GCN with a LSTM model to augment the conventional time-series model with information from nearby data points.

Enhanced algorithms:

* DeepGraphInfomax: can be used to train almost any model in an unsupervised way, for example HinSAGE for unsupervised heterogeneous graphs with node features.
* UnsupervisedSampler: supports a walker parameter to use other random walking algorithms such as BiasedRandomWalk, in addition to the default UniformRandomWalk.

The new release incorporates extensive performance enhancements, some of which include: 

* StellarGraph class now faster, easier to construct and smaller, with reduced memory usage to support larger graphs. 
* Better [demonstration notebooks](https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/demos/index.html) and documentation to make the library more accessible to new and existing users.
* Better Neo4j connectivity, including GraphSAGE neighborhood sampling from Neo4j and a demo notebook for loading and storing Neo4j graphs.
* Node feature sampling now \~4× faster via better data layout, speeding up configurations of GraphSAGE (and HinSAGE) 
* Addition of PROTEINS dataset for graph classification demo[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/1282)
* Creating a RelationalFullBatchNodeGenerator now 18x faster and requires much less memory (560x smaller) 

Jump into the new release on [GitHub](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph). StellarGraph is a Python 3 library. See full v1.0 release notes [here](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

We always welcome feedback and contributions.

t3_gdiy0f,Show and tell dumpster fire,"As the title says this sub has become nothing but a show and tell for screen-recordings and screenshots of programs. While I think it is great that the users of r/Python are writing python programs, these posts are 95% of what is posted. I know this has been brought up before ([here](https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/eph0da/another_subreddit_about_python/), [here](https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bx3yn9/lets_talk_about_learning_posts/), [and here](https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/esgla9/just_a_little_rant/)), but clearly nothing has changed and if anything has gotten worse.

I wouldn't be as much of a whiny bitch about it if the sidebar still didn't say *News about the dynamic, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language Python*. No other sub dedicated to a programming language seems to have this problem. A few that somehow manage to serve the purpose of their name are

- r/javascript
- r/cpp
- r/swift
- r/golang
- r/rust
- r/haskell

Yet somehow r/Python manages to stand alone with the tsunami of crap that makes up most of these posts, which is a real shame because there used to be a lot of quality content here. I'm not saying there should be no `I made this` posts but having them all day everyday is turning this sub into a hot pile of garbage real fast.

Some posts to the sub [aren't even](https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/fu303u/3_days_ago_told_my_wife_id_learn_to_code_and/) [python related](https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/fr5561/beginners_guide_how_to_start_programming_in_python/) yet are kept around? Why?

There has got to be a solution to this, and to eliminate a few that have been previously mentioned:

- [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/) is not the solution; its a whole different website
- r/pythoncoding is long dead

I'm more than open to suggestions. At this point anything is better than nothing

t3_ge3ojf,How can I find work as a freelancer developer without any contacts or network within the industry?,"My background is finance and have worked in that industry for the last 4 years, over which time I taught myself Python extensively.

Recently over the last 3-4 months I’ve been seeking to break into freelance development, even more so now given quarantine. 

However, I have literally no resources or contacts given my background, and I’m really reluctant to use UpWork/Freelancer after having negative experiences on the sites in the past when I used them for financial consulting. I’m happy to take on any work regardless of the size, and I think I’m more than capable of handling any Python projects (honestly tho I probably have no idea given my background - it’s possible my stuff is elementary compared to the average dev).

At my day job, I write a lot of C code to parse and error check ASCII¹-based telegrams from other systems. We do of course have tools in place to decode said telegrams, but even with the tools, we end up with a lot of repetitive boilerplate. A recent water cooler talk fostered the idea of embedding Python in our code for the sole purpose of parsing and sanitizing. Especially when we have to deal with variable length strings, a lot of pain would go away. But I'm not so sure about how easy it will be to get the structured data back to the C code.

It is notable for having [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. In particular, the **Lorenz attractor** is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system. In popular media the '[butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect)' stems from the real-world implications of the Lorenz attractor, i.e. that in any physical system, in the absence of perfect knowledge of the initial conditions (even the minuscule disturbance of the air due to a butterfly flapping its wings), our ability to predict its future course will always fail. This underscores that physical systems can be completely deterministic and yet still be inherently unpredictable even in the absence of quantum effects. The shape of the Lorenz attractor itself, when plotted graphically, may also be seen to resemble a butterfly.

This is the Python Simulation, I was wondering if any of you can explain to me what exactly this code does.

t3_gds2o2,PyWordSearch - BeginnerProject,"Hello all,

This project auto-completes Word Search puzzles on [thewordsearch.com/](https://thewordsearch.com/) 

I'm currently about 1 month into Python (5/8/20 will be one month since my first script - though I have experience with VBA and slight experience with Java). This is my first 'real' project where the output isn't simple text/calculations.  I was heavily inspired by this particular Python Suduko Solver ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/fijxgq/i_made_a_bot_for_a_sudoku_game/)) which was inspired by the Computerphile video ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM)). 

I didn't want to copy the code (as I've already watched the video) so I applied a similar concept to a new problem - Word Searches.

How it works:

1. PyAutoGUI clicks on Google Chrome and Screenshot both the Board and the Wordlist
2. PyTesseracy extracts information
3. NumPy is used to create the ""table""
4. (Poorly) programed Algo to solve the puzzle (which returns coordinates)
5. I re-map the coordinates to the board and use PyAutoGUI to Click &amp; Drag solutions

Notes:

1. I WILL POST THE CODE LATER AND ADD AN EDIT TO THIS POST (&amp; POST IN COMMENTS) - I'm going to try to learn how to use Git/Github (not even sure the difference) to share this code (another learning experience) - I also want to clean it up a bit as the last revision was poorly done.
2. This still has problems differentiating ""D"" and ""O"" - this is a result (to my understanding) of the limitations of PyTesseract - also, I barely know what I'm doing - so it could be on my end as well. I happened to get lucky in these videos that I clipped. If it switches an ""O"" and a ""D"" it simply skips the word and continues onto the next. 
3. I appreciate any feedback (even though there is no code yet)
4. I appreciate what this community continues to do - inspiring everyone from all walks of life to learn. I hope to be in a position to give back sooner than later!

t3_gdsmx3,"Just wanted to know the actual numbers of how many people on this subreddit use this place for view and sharing their and other people's creative python posts (The so called ""I made this"" posts)...","I was just curious to know which side the majority actually is on after reading this recent post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/gdqfyz/response\_to\_overwhelming\_i\_made\_this\_posts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/gdqfyz/response_to_overwhelming_i_made_this_posts/) 

My opinion is that creativity should be allowed on this subreddit... I know seeing so many different people post their implementations of the A-star algorithm can get boring/annoying but python is a language that was built from the ground up to help people run their imagination wild, that is why it is so beginner friendly... Removing creative freedom will only do the community bad! I know I haven't given a solution here but I haven't been able to think a very good solution other than the obvious (like flairing and what not)...

I would love to know your opinions as well!

t3_gdthp0,Pycharm Venv Issues,"Anybody experienced anything like the below / know why this would keep happening?

Using Pycharm, set up a project as usual and everything is working as intended.

Open the project up one day and its telling me 'project interpereter invalid'. I attempt to fix but the venv i have created is now marked as '[invalid]' and cannot be assigned to the project.

The only 'fix' seems to be to completely delete the venv and remake, which, after the 7th time is getting repetitive.


Adding insult to injury, attempting to install all libraries for the project and pillow will not install.

The 'fix' for this seems to be to repeatedly upgrade / downgrade pip until it decides to install pillow. 


Whilst doing this i run into another issue where pycharm / venv fails to install pip when upgrading / downgrading.

The 'fix' for this is delete the venv and go back to step 1.....
